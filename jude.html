            <h1>AI in games</h1>
            <p1>The ability of AI to solve games has been used as a benchmark of progress in the field since it's infancy.
                From Garry Kasparov's historic defeat by Deep Blue to Alpha Zero's conquest of Go, find out how AI has evolved in the field.

                    <h1><u>Deep Blue</u></h1>
                    <p1>In 1996 Garry Kasparov fought IBM's Deep Blue computer in a six-game match game of chess, winning 4-2. 
                        After being upgraded, Kasparov was defeated in a rematch in 1997, making it the first time a computer 
                        defeated a world champion in a match of chess. 
                        Deep Blue didn't use machine learning and rather relied on a hand-crafted algorithm, an opening book and 
                        some specialist hardware. Compared to modern AIs this is a very primative system, as it has no capability to 
                        learn on it's own.

                    <h1><u>AlphaGo</u></h1>
                    <p1>In May 2017, AlphaGo won against world champion Ki Jie 3-0. Go is a lot more complicated than chess due to
                        a much larger number of possible moves and states, so many researchers thought that it would take a longer 
                        until AI would master Go. DeepMind's AlphaGo broke those expectations by training a neural network on the games 
                        of masters and by playing it against itself. Unlike Deep Blue, this AI used deep learning to improve from training
                        without any modification to it's code being needed.

                    <h1><u>Alpha Zero and Mu Zero</u></h1>
                    <p1>Following on from AlphaGo, Alpha Zero could play chess, shogi and go. Not only was this AI more general, it also no
                        longer relied on knowledge learnt from human games as it was completely self taught. This was made possible thanks to
                        advances made in hardware and algorithms used. After just 9 hours of self play, Alpha Zero was capable of defeating
                        stockfish version 8. Taking this one step further in a paper in 2019, Mu Zero was not told the rules of the games of
                        which it was learning to play. Alpha Zero could only play games where there are 2 players with only a win, draw and lose 
                        condition. However, Mu Zero doesn't have this restriction and was also learnt how to play a standard suite of Atari games.
