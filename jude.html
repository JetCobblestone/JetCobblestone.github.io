            <h1>Artificial Intelligence in games</h1>
            <p>The ability of an AI to play games has been used as a metric of progress in the field. Since Deep Blue's historic victory against Garry Kasparov in 1997, AIs have cemented their dominance and expanded further into other games such as Go. These succeses will be talked about in this page</p>

            <h1><u>Deepblue</u></h1>
            <p1>In 1996 Garry Kasparov fought IBM's Deep Blue computer in a six-game match game of chess, winning 4-2. After being upgraded, Kasparov was defeated in a rematch in 1997, making it the first time a computer defeated a world champion in a match of chess.</p1>
