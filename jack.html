            <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Historical and Cultural Preservation</h1>

            <p>Artificial intelligence and machine learning has many applications in aiding in the preservation of history and culture; it allows use to recreate important places or objects in virtual environments, preserving them for future generations. Machine learning techniques have also been used to develop tools to allow us to protect modern cultures from being lost to history.</p>

                    <h3>Language Preservation</h3>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is being used to create tools to help preserve languages that are under threat. Languages like Inuktitut, which is spoken by the people of Inuit Nunangat in Nunavut, Canada. In partnership with the Government of Nunavut, Microsoft has used neural network translation models to incorporate Inuktitut and other Inuktut dialects into Microsoft Translator, allowing unilingual speakers of these languages to be able to access essential services such as healthcare. This will help avoid the Inuktitut language going extinct, a very real threat to many indigenous languages in North America. </p>

                    <h3>Digitising of Records</h3>
                    <p>Many records of the past stored in archives around the world are under threat; although archivists use many techniques to maintain and preserve texts, eventually time takes its course and knowledge is lost permenantly. AI projects have used handwriting recognition models in combination with robotics to automatically move through manuscripts and records, digitising the data. This helps preserve the texts for the future, as well as make them easier to access by the global scholastic community. Projects like Time Machine Europe are preserving texts in cities across Europe, hoping to build a digital archive of Europe's history, with plans of using AI to find patterns in the digital history that have been missed before, giving us a greater understand of the past.</p>

                    <h3>Architectural Preservation</h3>
                    <p>AI is being used to preserve ancient architecture, both physically and virtually. Ancient Olympia: Common Grounds is a joint project between Microsoft and the Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Sports to scan ruins from Ancient Greece and reconstruct them as virtual models, with AI being used to predict where missing material is. Meanwhile in China, Intel and the China Foundation for Cultural Heritage Conservation are using AI to analyse potentially fragile and hard-to-access areas of the Great Wall of China, with the AI model pinpointing areas that requires maintenance from drone footage.</p>
