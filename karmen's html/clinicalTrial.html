                <p class="text-black font-tertiary" style="font-size:160%; font-family:'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">Due to the characteristic of AI in machine learning, neural networks, deep learning, natural language processing and computer vision, especially in the deepened healthcare field, AI is more helpful than human because they can deal with more data and analyze them to produce precise outcomes. 
                  For instance, the most common “linear and sequential” clinical trials are the standards for ensuring the efficiency and safety of new drugs. The long, tired and true method for distinct and defined stages of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was designed for evaluating mass-market pharmaceuticals and has remained mostly unchanged in recent decades. These requires handling huge amount of data, which matched with AI perfectly.</p>
