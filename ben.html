                    <h3>Personalised Education</h3>
                    <p>AI can use data around student attention, interest, aptitude, #
                        and ability to recommend Personalised coursework. This will help build the capability 
                        of students towards a specific career path which is suited to their strengths and interests.

                    <p>Currently, AI can automate grading for nearly all kinds of multiple-choice and fill-in-the-blank exams.
                         As essay-grading software continues to evolve, this range of capabilities will continue to expand. Automating
                        mundane tasks will allow teachers to spend more time in front of students and will overall improve the quality of education.

                    <p>E-learning from an AI tutor involves that learners are free to gain deep understanding.
                       Because students have more time to reflect or relax if they need. 
                       Artificial Intelligence trainers are more knowledgeable and less error-prone.
                       Online learning allows students to get an education anywhere in the world including outside physical classrooms
